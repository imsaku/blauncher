!!THIS REPO IS MADE FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.!!
Exploits licensing service and lets you play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on Windows 10/11 machines for free!
Method used is force disabling ClipSVC service and killing RuntimeBroker.exe while loading the game in order to get into the game without the trial. I know that this method isn't perfect at all, but it works at the very least ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
